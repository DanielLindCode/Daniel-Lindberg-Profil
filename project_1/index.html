                Thank you for visiting my portfolio page!
                My name is Daniel and I’m an inspiring Java programmer.
                This website is our first mini-project, and I will try and improve it as the course continues.
                I haven’t worked with CSS before but now I really like to explore more what the possibilities are with
                layout and design.

            <h4>A little about me</h4>
            <p>
                As stated, my name is Daniel and I’m from the southern parts of Sweden. I’m 33 years old and will
                soon
                be living together with my girlfriend outside of Malmö.
                I have interests in graphics and have studied game graphics. I like design and creative thinking.
                In my spare time I enjoy gaming, moves and hanging out with friends! Id like to get more into
                training
                and be more active. I used to go out fishing and I still enjoy being outside but sadly I haven’t
                been
                able to fish in a while.
